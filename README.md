# GraphQL with Apollo

This is a knowledge sharing that I gave on 09/08/2018 for [tes](https://engineering.tes.com/) engineers.
It's about how to use apollo client to run queries, mutations and handle the internal cache.

In order to see the demo you need a `tes-stage` account and copy&paste your token in `ApolloProvider.js` then you can `npm start` and enjoy the presentation.
